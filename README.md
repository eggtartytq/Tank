And the difference on our project is, we made the menu of it, and make the win/loss system and win/loss show. We also made on side of the enemy more strong and delete our teammates. We also made a HP text to show the HP and press Q to add the HP which is the cheating process. We also add background music to the game.And we also add a function which can restrat the game by pressing "esc".
This game Tank, the player control the tank will facing some AI and try to be the last tank standing on the field.

Charles(50%): AI, Player control,
Loki(50%): Menu, weapon,

Bug:we suppose to have click esc to restart the game, but whenever we click it, it will show an error: The object of type 'GameObject' has been destoryed but you are still trying to access it. And because this error, we can't build the game.
